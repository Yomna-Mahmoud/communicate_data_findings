## Dataset

> This dataset is flights data sets which is the flights numbers unique carriers , delay times, cancellations , origin and destination of trip.
The wrangling I did was replacing the unique carrier codes with their full names in addition to dropping duplicates 


## Summary of Findings

> My findings is that the best airline to fly on to in USA is depending on the cancellations and the average delay in flights


## Key Insights for Presentation

>The key insights will be the change of the delay with the cancellations scatter plot and the delay vs cancellations vs unique airline carrier
